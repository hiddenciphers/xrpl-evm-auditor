## ðŸš¨ XRPL-Specific Rule Proposal

### ðŸ“œ Describe the Rule

> **What vulnerability, pattern, or behavior should this rule detect?**  
> Example: Detect unsafe handling of `wXRP.deposit{value: amount}();` without validating value/amount.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Example of Bad Code (Should Trigger Warning)

```solidity
// Example of vulnerable or improper code that should be flagged

contract Example {
    function bridgeXRP(address dest, uint256 amount) public {
        bridge.sendToXRPL(dest, amount); // No validation on dest
    }
}
```

---

## âœ… Example of Good Code (Should NOT Trigger Warning)

```solidity
// Example of proper/secure code that should pass without issues

contract Example {
    function bridgeXRP(address dest, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(dest != address(0), "Invalid destination");
        bridge.sendToXRPL(dest, amount);
    }
}
```

## ðŸ§­ Why is this Important for XRPL EVM?

Why is this unique to XRPL EVM? What risks are involved if ignored?

---

## âœ… Optional

ðŸ”´ Suggested Severity: Low / Medium / High

ðŸ›  Suggested Fix or Refactor (Example):

```typescript
require(dest != address(0), "Invalid destination");
```
